# D277-FrontEndDev

This website was created for WGU's D277. It outline's some general facts about Kentucky and highlights options you can use for HTML, CSS, and Javascript The webpage was created on a 34" widescreen 2k monitor. Later testing with 1080p made the page look off, but overall usable. The sidebar has some dynamic features including expanding/contracting, highlighting, and overlay/tooltip options. The form will ensure that each field is completed and that an email was added in email format.
